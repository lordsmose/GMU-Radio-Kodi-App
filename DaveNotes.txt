Notes from Dave...
	If you want to try out what we have here on your laptop/desktop/raspberry pi, take the folder and .zip it. Then open kodi and go to SYSTEM > SETTINGS > ADD-ONS > Install from zip file. Navigate to the folder your zip file is in and click OK. Then the GMU radio plugin will show when you go to MUSIC > ADD-ONS. Slack me if you have any questions.
